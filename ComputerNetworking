# Computer Networking: 

⦁	connecting devices to enable communication 

### **Components of networking:**

⦁	Devices: computers, smart phones, printers
⦁	Services: websites, file servers, email systems
⦁	Infrastructure: routers, switches, firewalls
Purpose of networking:
⦁	share data and resources
⦁	ensure secure and efficient communication between devices and services

### **Key Terminology:**

⦁	IP Address: Unique number assigned to every device on a network
⦁	Router: Connects your local network to internet
⦁	Switch: Connects multiple devices within a local network
⦁	Firewall: blocks unauthorized access to or from a network
⦁	LAN: local area, like home or office
⦁	DNS: Translates domain names to an IP address
⦁	DHCP: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices 

### **Types of Networks**

⦁	Personal Area Network: Bluetooth, phone communication
⦁	LAN: Home, office wifi network
⦁	WLAN: Wifi network in homes, offices, or public spaces
⦁	WAN: the internet
⦁	VPN: Creates secure, encrypted "tunnel" over public network
⦁	SAN: Used for data storage access in enterprise environments 

### **OSI Model**

7 layers of the OSI Model:
⦁	physical layer: cables, wires, physical hardware 
⦁	Data link: MAC addresses and ethernet
⦁	Network: IP addresses and routers 
⦁	Transport: TCP / UP and port numbers
⦁	Session: Manages communication sessions 
⦁	Presentation: Data formatting 
⦁	Application: interface you interact with (web browser, email app...)


### **IP Addresses**

* **IPv4**: 32-bit numeric address, e.g., `192.168.1.1`
* **IPv6**: 128-bit hexadecimal address, e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334`
* **Static IP**: Manually assigned, stays constant.
* **Dynamic IP**: Assigned by DHCP server and may change over time.

### **DNS (Domain Name System)**

* Converts human-readable domain names (like `google.com`) into IP addresses.
* Hierarchical: Root → TLD (.com) → Domain → Subdomain.

---

### **Subnetting**

* Used to divide networks into smaller, manageable sections (subnets).
* Helps in optimizing performance and improving security.
* Subnet mask example: `255.255.255.0` = `/24` subnet.

---

### **Port Numbers & Common Protocols**

* **HTTP**: 80
* **HTTPS**: 443
* **FTP**: 21
* **SSH**: 22
* **DNS**: 53
* **SMTP**: 25
* **IMAP/POP3**: 143 / 110
* **RDP**: 3389

---

### **Firewalls**

* Control traffic entering/leaving a network.
* Can be software or hardware-based.
* Filters based on IP, port, protocol, etc.

---

### **Public vs Private Networks**

* **Private**: Secure internal network (e.g., home, office LAN).
* **Public**: Open networks (e.g., coffee shop Wi-Fi); usually restrict services and require firewalls/VPN.

---

### **Basics of Wireless Networking**

* **Wi-Fi Standards**: 802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax
* **Frequency Bands**: 2.4GHz (more range), 5GHz (faster, less interference)
* **Encryption**: WPA2, WPA3 for secure connections.
* **SSID**: Name of wireless network.
* **Access Point (AP)**: Device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network.

---

### **Certifications to Consider**

* **CompTIA Network+**: General foundational networking cert. Great for MSPs, help desk, sysadmin roles.
* **Microsoft Azure AZ-104**: Focuses on networking within Azure (VNets, NSGs, Azure Firewall, etc.)
* **Cisco CCNA**: In-depth on routing/switching, subnetting, CLI configs, enterprise networking (sought after in large orgs).
